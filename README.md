# HTTP Status Code Emoji Cheatsheet

A concise, developer-friendly cheatsheet that maps common HTTP status codes to memorable emojis. Designed to make web debugging, documentation, and teaching more approachable and visually intuitive.

This project provides an at-a-glance reference you can use in API docs, code comments, workshops, or anywhere you want to add clarity (and a little personality) to HTTP responses.

## Why This Exists

HTTP status codes are essential, but they can be hard to memorize and even harder to quickly communicate. Associating each status with a simple emoji:

* Reduces cognitive load
* Speeds up onboarding for beginners
* Adds visual cues to logs and documentation
* Helps teams quickly scan API behavior

## Usage

You can use this cheatsheet in:

* Documentation (Markdown, API references)
* Slides and workshops
* IDE snippets or Git commit templates
* Logging utilities
* Teaching materials
* Issue triage templates

If you want to embed it programmatically, a JSON version is recommended:

```json
{
  "200": "✅",
  "201": "🎉",
  "404": "❓",
  "500": "💥"
}
```

## Contributing

* Suggesting alternative emojis
* Adding missing status codes
* Translating the cheatsheet
* Improving consistency or readability
